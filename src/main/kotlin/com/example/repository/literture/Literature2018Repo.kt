       UNSEEN PROSE AND POETRY Read the passage and answer questions 21 to 25.
       Jame's heart beat madly as he and Alice
       approached the beeping metal detector at the entrance. The oblivious swinging door hugged the couple with inviting, outstretched arms and ushered them into the lobby in genial welcome. The receptionist asked James to surrender any valuable he had; If they got lost,
       management would not be liable. James looked at Alice, his wife returned his guilt
       stricken, dubious look with an innocent, trusting smile. What would he do if jewels went missing? How would he explain it to himself? What would he have gained by his mischief? What had come over James so shamelessly to decide to rob his own wife? The swindled wornan stood innocently beside her unrepentant husband as he took the key to their room with hands that shook slightly.

    Poison ivy came up like a rose in red and thorny garb

    I should've only looked, and not leapt For away and over my rising moon she flew on clipped wings of my dream
    now a song-filled air pocket of serenades. A love's wretch, my dream is a hombill
